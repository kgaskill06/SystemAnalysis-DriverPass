# SystemAnalysis-DriverPass

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?:
  The DriverPass client was a small business looking capture the untapped market for training students for their driving test. They wanted students to be able to take practice tests online and schedule driving practice appointments. 

What did you do particularly well?: 
  I felt I was able to capture the use-cases well and create the necessary diagrams that give developers a great visual picture of the necessary functions and purpose this the cases were creating. In addition to diagrams, I did feel I did well in listing all the system requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?:
  One part I would like to perhaps improve upon would be the diagrams, I would of wanted to make my sequence digram reflect a loop from paymnet being denied and taking you back to the enter payment.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I first started by taking a look at how they wanted their system to operate from a customer's viewpoint while keeping in mind the goals of DriverPass. I know their goal is to capture customer information via phone and the website. So knowing the customer will access their website and see the features, I would need to start thinking the process it takes to create an account, look at the packages being offered and what steps would be taken when a customer chooses to purchase a selected package. Overall the process should be simple for any user which will help capture more business and allowing employee users to manage the system easier. You have to also understand their goals and it helps when you can think of each goal as a stepping stone. First step, have a user create an account, Second step show the users the bundles being offered, etc. As each step progresses, I am further into completing all client goals.
 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I like to capture all the client goals and the functional requirementment steps at each goal in order to understand, 1: the purpose, and 2: the requirement, so I can create a roadmap 3: The how. Once I have these 3 steps in mind I can start to devise use cases to start individually diagraming each use case with their goal and how to process mapped out visually. This will create an overall bigger picture when I bring all the diagrams together one part at a time.
